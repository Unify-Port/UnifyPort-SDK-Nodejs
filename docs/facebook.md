# Facebook channel

[English](facebook.md) | [简体中文](zh-CN/facebook.md)

This source update adds `provider=facebook` to the existing Device API client. It adds no HTTP routes or standard event names and does not announce a package release or deployment.

Create an account with `provider=facebook`, `auth_mode=session` and an available `region`. Submit a short-lived HTTPS `session_url` through `importAccountAuthSession`, then inspect `refreshAccountRuntime`. Imported/authorized session material does not prove the account is running; wait for `runtime_status=running` before sending. Session material and its URL are credentials: keep them out of logs and model input.

Use `listConversations` with `type=user`. It covers the currently synchronized sendable E2EE direct conversations, not full history. Preserve opaque cursors; an empty filtered page with `has_more=true` is not the end. Use its string conversation IDs unchanged for `sendMessage`.

Send one text message or one image/video/audio/document/file attachment per request. Groups, channels, QR/code authorization, caption, mentions, quoted replies, conversation detail/write actions, contacts, message actions, posts/comments and calls are outside this channel's initial scope. Existing shared request types do not prove every provider implements every option. `accepted` proves channel acknowledgement, not delivery/read status. Do not automatically resend an uncertain result or extend the retry allowlist.

## Standard Webhooks

The source contract declares `facebookMessageReceived`, `facebookAccountAuthSucceeded`, `facebookAccountStatusUpdated` and `facebookAccountAuthFailed`. They reuse `message.received`, `account.auth.succeeded`, `account.status.updated` and `account.auth.failed`; no `facebook.*` event names are introduced. Actual availability and real-account delivery require separate environment acceptance.

- `message.received` may have `direction=inbound` or `outbound`. Preserve string IDs, including values beyond JavaScript's safe integer range. A received `reply_to_message_id` is context, not a sending permission or a `reply_token`.
- Ordinary text/media omit `message.type`; a single sticker without text may use `sticker`. Preserve ordered attachments, absent media URLs, zero sizes/durations and explicit `false`. Do not invent a URL for encrypted or unavailable media.
- Attachment `metadata.duration` retains its native value with an unconfirmed unit; it is not `duration_ms`.
- Public timestamps use UTC RFC3339 with available fractional precision. Missing native message time leaves `sent_at` absent; `occurred_at` can be observation time and is not a message creation time.
- Ordinary connection errors use `account.status.updated` with `runtime_status=error` and omit `auth_status`. They do not revoke authorization. Confirmed authorization failures use `account.auth.failed`, `auth_status=failed` and `runtime_status=disconnected`.
- Reuse the existing raw-body signature verification and top-level event-ID deduplication. Retries retain event identity; the SDK neither generates IDs nor guarantees exactly-once delivery. Unknown callbacks and post comments do not become Facebook business events.

The four receiver declarations are types only, not callable SDK or MCP methods. No new MCP tools or automatic retries are enabled.
